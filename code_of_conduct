## My Pledge

I am committed to making participation in this project and its community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

I welcome all contributors and strive to create a welcoming and inspiring community for everyone.

## My Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## My Responsibilities

As a project maintainer, I am responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and am expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

I have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and I will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when I am representing the project or its community. Examples of representing the project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting me. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. I am obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
